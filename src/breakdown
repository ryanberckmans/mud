"only core" experience
core vectors/connect, tick, no ll support
core is manager of client ids
no prompt with core

what about the client - ??
    what does client contain?
    not prompt ??
    perhaps client is a pkg containing prompt ??
    rename core pkg to "tick"
    perhaps core IS tick/client/prompt - i like this - basic shell experience
            core could contain interfaces to add a "per tick" callback: hook for combat engine
