** mob.playerControlledMobs
*** map of ( clientId, currentlyControlledMob )
*** defined for all clientId
*** responsible for loading or creating the mob a player should be controlling
*** who is responsible for saving/unloading a player's mobs when they quit?
*** what about ll? should rebind to mob on reconnect, but this needs accounts
** mob.instances
*** all mob instances currently in game
*** ignorant of whether zone mob, pet, player, transient, etc
** for now, all mobs simply have rootCmdMap
** core.prompt, core.cmds goes to mob


* logon sequence
** connection
** 

* parsers/command classes
** builder commands
