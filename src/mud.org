* migrating to SOA using twisted
** service template
*** we don't really need a svc template
**** mud requires mods
**** most services don't require mods
**** not much shared code
** twisted services
*** twisted xmlrpc - can only receive and return basic datatypes
*** endpoint configuration files, i.e. how to tell what url:port to point at
*** TODO ? xmlrpc ssl
*** TODO ? how do we authenticate xmlrpc
*** what role does mods-enabled have in SOA?
**** allows plugging of features, even if features are remote services 
**** mods are really just libraries which may have no dependents
**** a mod or library may point to a remote svc, but this is abstracted from the downstream
*** what type of features should be mods?
**** xmlrpc supports only basic datatypes, so features requiring tossing around complex data types shouldn't be mods.
**** features with many upstreams can be mods, but then they may not be upstreams
***** e.g. combat could be a mod, but it relies on equip, spell affects, etc, and how do we know something won't rely on combat?

* migrating away from root c++
** why?
*** twistd
*** replacing c++ socket server with twisted service
** features that need migration
*** socket server
*** tick loop - what does this look like in SOA?
**** naively, just transfers data from socket server to command handler

* roadmap
** migrate zr1 to service
*** but it's two svcs
*** the beam shopping cart, which is more or less current python zr1 impl
*** the science layer, which is more or less current c++ zr1 impl
*** start with c++
